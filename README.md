# DocTrack üè•‚ú®

Welcome to **DocTrack**,

Ever found yourself scanning through a doctor's name,
wondering if you've visited them before
or how the session went?

Have you had an uncomfortable or notable experience
with medical personnel that you couldn't document
in your medical service provider's app?

**DocTrack** offers a centralized, secure approach
to personal notes on your healthcare experiences,
aiming to provide clarity and control over your medical journey.
